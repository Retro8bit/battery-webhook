  A very brief setup for Battery Webhook. I recommend that you read the entirety
  of the documentation to get to know all of the features.

# Quick Start

Open the Battery Webhook app, then go to **Settings**. Ensure the **Webhook Service Type** is set to whatever your webhook corresponds to, then paste the URL into the webhook URL text field.

Now, set a display name in the Display Name field (it's just used to identify you to the webhook and doesn't have to be a username or your real name).

You should now be able to send battery info.

  Battery Webhook is an app that lets you send your battery info to popular
  services using webhooks.

# Introduction

To use it, you'll need to configure Battery Webhook with a webhook to push to, as well as filling out some basic info on how you would like to appear to the webhook (such as a display name).

If you already have a webhook you want to provide to Battery Webhook and know it is fully supported, see [Quick Start](quick-start.md). Otherwise, continue reading.

### What is a webhook?

A **webhook** is a method of communication to a web application. It allows an application to send real-time data to another application whenever a specific event occurs.

In the case of Battery Webhook, the real-time data is your device's battery information, and the event is either manual or automated. The services we support sending to are documented in another page, [Supported Services](../supported-services/).

### Why should I use this?

Battery Webhook can send something like the following whenever you open the app and manually tap Send Battery Info:

<div data-full-width="false">

</div>

That's fine and all, but not very useful unless you feel like opening the app every time you want to report battery info. **However**, Battery Webhook supports power-efficient automations! So you can have it send battery info whenever you plug in, unplug or fully charge your device, as seen below:

Automations allow Battery Webhook to inform you about power state changes for devices that you may want to be informed about, such as:

* A MacBook that you need on and charged at all times and want to know if it loses power
* A Mac with a UPS attached and you want to know if it ever loses power (useful for knowing if there's a power outage or similar)
* An old iPhone or iPad being used as an indoor camera and you must know if it gets unplugged
* How long your phone took to charge overnight
* Friend's devices, just for fun

### What about my privacy?

Battery Webhook collects the following information automatically:&#x20;

* Battery level (example: 15%)
* Device model (example: iPhone 15 Pro Max)
* Device name (example: iPhone - but can be customized)
* OS version (example: 17.2)
* Date and time

It also has you provide the following information:

* Display Name (required, doesn't need to be a real name or username)
* Pronoun (optional, only used for automations)

You can opt out of sending some of the collected into to webhooks, which is covered later on. For most users, however, this isn't needed.

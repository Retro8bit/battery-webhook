            "localizedDescription": "Webhooks allow an application to send real-time data to another application whenever a specific event occurs. What if you could send battery information whenever you connected your device to power? Even better, what if you could easily send it to a messaging app like Discord, in an easy-to-read format?\n\nBattery Webhook achieves this and also has:\n- A fully modern design, built in Swift and SwiftUI\n- Manual sending of battery info in the app\n- Automations support with Shortcuts Automations\n- Siri Shortcuts support\n- A highly power efficient design, with minimal power usage\n\nIt is simple to use the app, just fill out a few basic details and you can send your device's battery info. If you ever run into any roadblocks, there's step-by-step documentation available.\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.thatstel.la/battery-webhook\nSource code and bug reports: https://github.com/ThatStella7922/battery-webhook\n\nNote: Battery Webhook is not affiliated with or endorsed by Discord Inc in any way. All trademarks are property of their respective owners.\nNote 2: Battery Webhook installed from AltStore/SideStore does not include the Apple Watch app.",
